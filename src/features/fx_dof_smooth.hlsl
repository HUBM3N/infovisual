// The gather leaves a residual grain because its taps are a spiral and not a grid, so a
// separable gaussian runs after it -- but WHICH pixels it may pull in is the whole
// difference between a blur that dissolves a silhouette and one that draws it sharper than
// anything around it.
//
// This is qUINT ADoF's rule (PS_DoF_Gauss1/2): every tap is weighted by HOW MUCH BLURRIER IT
// IS than this pixel (its "bleed fix"), the centre tap is on exactly those same terms, and
// the result is lerped by the total weight -- a blurred pixel among blurrier ones is
// replaced by them, a sharp one keeps itself because nothing around it earns any weight. The
// x4 buildup is ADoF's too: the gaussian is at full width by a coc of a quarter, so the
// smoothing arrives WITH the blur instead of trailing it.
//
//   c1 = half the sharp band, max blur radius in pixels, 1/width, 1/height
//   c4 = direction x, direction y, bleed factor (ADoF's 0.25), smoothening amount
