// McGuire et al. 2012 "A Reconstruction Filter for Plausible Motion Blur", with Guertin et
// al. 2014's feature-aware weighting. It is a RESAMPLE, not a smear: every tap is asked three
// questions and the answers multiply.
//
//   depth      a tap in front of this pixel can only paint over it, a tap behind it can only
//              be revealed by it. This is the whole reason the gun does not drag across the
//              wall and the wall does not bleed into the gun, with no depth-range test.
//   spread     did the tap's own streak actually reach this far during the shutter? A still
//              tap answers no at every distance, which keeps anything static out of the blur.
//   direction  how parallel the tap's motion is to the line being walked. A tap sliding across
//              the scan is not part of this streak.
//
// Two accumulators, the paper's: foreground taps are added on top, background taps fill in what
// the moving thing uncovered, and whatever weight is left at the end is filled with the
// background rather than the centre -- which is what stops the hard edge around a fast object.
//
// Blurring is done in ~linear light with the highlights pushed out by an invertible reinhard:
// a tracer smeared in gamma space goes grey, in linear it stays a streak of light.
//
// THE FENCE. Pass one parks every gun pixel under c8.y, so:
//   world run   a gun pixel keeps its own colour outright -- the world reaching INTO the gun
//               is the smear that drags a wall across your weapon.
//   gun run     a gun pixel takes gun taps only; a world pixel takes whatever reaches it,
//               which in that run is the gun smearing onto the wall behind it. That is what an
//               exposure does, and it is the half people actually see.
//
//   c2 = tap cap, max streak, tile size, frame noise
