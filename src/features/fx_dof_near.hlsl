// CinematicDOF's PS_NearBokehBlur. It runs over the finished far-plane image and its radius
// comes from the blurred field, not from this pixel's own depth -- which is the whole trick:
// a sharp wall pixel a few pixels outside a blurred player still gets a radius, still
// gathers, and is then blended in by an alpha that falls off with the field. That fade IS
// the soft edge.
//
// No occlusion test anywhere in the loop. A foreground is in front of everything by
// definition, so it is allowed to bleed over all of it -- the far gather already refused
// every near tap for the same reason.
//
//   s0 the far-plane result, s1 depth (read for ONE thing: telling the viewmodel apart),
//   s2 the blurred near coc field
//   c1 = half the sharp band, max blur radius in pixels, 1/width, 1/height
//   c2 = viewmodel cutoff (RAW depth), -, VIEWMODEL PASS, -
