// CinematicDOF's PS_CoCGaussian1/2, and it is the one thing a plain gather never has: a
// field that says "a blurred foreground reaches THIS far out", including over pixels that
// are perfectly sharp themselves. Without it the near plane can only paint inside its own
// silhouette and that silhouette stays a razor line however hard the interior is blurred.
//
// THE FIELD IS A MAX, NOT AN AVERAGE, and that is the difference between a soft edge and a
// slightly less hard one. Blurring the coc itself halves it at the silhouette and it is gone
// a few pixels out. This instead asks "what is the biggest coc whose own radius still
// REACHES me": every tap is worth its coc minus the distance it travelled, in units of the
// max blur. Inside the foreground that is a plateau at its own coc, and outside it decays
// linearly to nothing exactly where its disc ends. A max is separable the way an average is,
// so it is still two half-res draws.
//
//   c1 = half the sharp band, max blur radius in pixels, 1/width, 1/height
//   c4 = direction x, direction y, reading the prepared alpha, -
