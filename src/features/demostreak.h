// Killstreak carry-over across demos. Same bytes in dih and fpsoverlay (src/features/demostreak.h)
// -- edit one, copy to the other. Tested by tests/demostreak_test.cpp.
//
// A frag video runs one streak through several demos, so loading a demo must not end it. A load
// creates the recorded player, which fires localplayer_changeteam / localplayer_changeclass
// (c_tf_player.cpp:4606/4645), and dih also sees the old session drop ("left server"); all three
// used to reset the count. Inside a demo only the recorded player's own death ends a streak now.
//
// The catch is a rewind: the engine rewinds by loading the SAME file again and skipping up to the
// tick, so every kill before that tick fires a second time. The streak the demo was loaded with is
// kept aside, and a reload of the same demo (same map + length, playback tick gone backwards) puts
// it back before the replayed kills count again.
