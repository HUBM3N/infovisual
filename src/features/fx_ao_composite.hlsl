//
// WHERE THE FRAME COPY WENT: nowhere -- there is none. This writes 1-occlusion and the
// blend unit multiplies it into the frame (SRCBLEND ZERO, DESTBLEND SRCCOLOR), so unlike a
// blur pass it never has to read the frame back. One less fullscreen copy per frame, and
// msaa safe for free.
//
// The taps are MXAO's own eight -- a cross that covers two and a half texels without ever
// sampling the same one twice.
//
// DIH: THE PER-TAP DEPTH FETCH IS GONE. The prepare pass already writes a normal per pixel
// and its alpha was doing nothing, so the depth the bilateral weight needs rides along in
// it -- one fetch a tap instead of two, eight fewer full-res reads and eight fewer
// unprojections per pixel. The encode is z/(z+AO_ZK), matching fx_ao_prepare.hlsl.
//
//   c0 = zNear, zFar, 1/occlusionWidth, 1/occlusionHeight
//   c1 = blur radius, fade end, tan(fovX/2), tan(fovY/2)
//   c2 = intensity, fade start, 1/(fadeEnd-fadeStart), viewmodel raw-depth cutoff
//   c3 = fog start, 1/(fogEnd-fogStart), fog density, -
//
// DIH: coldtires' smoke-cloud block (c4..c10) is gone. It exists because a CS smoke cloud
// writes no depth, so the gather shades creases nobody can see through it; TF2 has no
// equivalent volume the pass has to be told about.
