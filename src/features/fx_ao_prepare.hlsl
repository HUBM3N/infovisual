// blur does not have to fetch the z buffer again beside every normal it reads. Eight taps x
// one fewer texture is eight fetches a pixel at full frame size.

// step, and the blur's own depth tolerance is 5% of z -- eleven units at the near end. The
// hyperbolic one holds its RELATIVE precision instead, about 2% over the whole range the
// term is alive in, which sits comfortably inside that tolerance.
